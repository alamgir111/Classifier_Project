# Classifier Performance Visualization




## Project Description

 This project provides various visualizations to analyze the performance of classifiers using synthetic data. The visualizations include scatterplots, bar charts, and interactive elements to assess and compare classifier accuracy and performance. Each task in this project aims to enhance understanding and interpretation of classifier results through custom visual representations and interactive features.


## Tasks Overview

- Task 1A: Developed a scatterplot to categorize data points into three categories based on classifier performance: correctly classified by both, correctly classified by only one, and incorrectly classified by both classifiers.

- Task 1B: Created a customized stacked bar chart to display the performance of classifiers for each class. The chart includes distinct visual encodings for correct and incorrect predictions, highlighting classifier performance.

- Task 1C: Implemented linked interactivity between a scatterplot and a bar chart using Bokeh. This feature allows users to dynamically update the bar chart based on selections made in the scatterplot, providing detailed insights into classifier performance for selected data points.

- Task 2C: Proposed new visualization methods, such as performance heatmaps and interactive dashboards, to enhance the analysis of classifier performance. These methods aim to provide a comprehensive view of classifier strengths and weaknesses.
## How to Install and Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository: 

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/alamgir111/Classifier_Project.git

```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
 cd Classifier_Project

```
3. Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can use pip to install them:

```bash
 pip install pandas matplotlib bokeh plotly

```
4. Run the Code:
- For scatterplots and bar charts

```bash
 python your_script_name.py

```
- For interactive visualizations, run the Bokeh server:

```bash
 bokeh serve --show your_script_name.py

```
## How to Use the Project
- Task 1A Visualization: Run the script to generate and view the scatterplot.
- Task 1B Visualization: Execute the script to produce the customized stacked bar chart.
- Task 1C Visualization: Launch the Bokeh server to interactively explore the scatterplot and bar chart.
- Task 2C Visualization: Use the provided script to create and view the performance heatmap.
